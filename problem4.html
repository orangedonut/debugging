    <h1>Debugging: Problem 4</h1>
    <p>Use the errors you see in Google Chrome's JavaScript

        <p>In problem4.js, we tried to create two shapes in
           JavaScript and add them to an SVG canvas below. But
            neither of them are showing up! Look at the error
            messages you see and fix the code in problem4.js so
             the shapes show up. When you get this working, you
              should see two shapes below: a circle and a rectangle.
